# Gym Management Database Design and Implementation

## Overview
This project is a part of CSc 460 - Database Design, Fall 2023, under the guidance of Prof. McCann. Designed by Zhenyu Qi and Daniel Bazmandeh, it aims to build a database-driven information management system for a fictional fitness center named GYM 460. The goal is to design the underlying database and define application functionalities, implementing this application using Oracle within a text-based JDBC program.

## Features
- **Two-Tier Client-Server Architecture:**
  - **Database Back-End:** Runs the Oracle DBMS. Responsibilities include designing the database relational schema, creating tables, populating initial data, and ensuring schema satisfies 3NF and BCNF.
  - **JDBC Front-End:** A text-based user interface handling all required functionalities.

## Application Domain
GYM 460 features various components crucial for its operation:
- **Member Information Management:** Store basic member information and handle membership levels with corresponding discounts.
- **Course and Package Management:** Offer and manage various fitness class packages.
- **Trainer Scheduling:** Manage trainers' schedules and prevent overlapping times.
- **Equipment Tracking:** Record check-out and return times for borrowed equipment.
- **Transaction Records:** Meticulously maintain transaction details for each user interaction.

## Functionalities
The system is expected to perform operations such as:
- Record insertion, deletion, and update.
- Queries based on the gym's operational needs.
- Manage memberships, courses, and course packages.

## Installation and Usage
- **Compilation Instructions:** [Instructions on how to compile the application]
- **Execution Instructions:** [Instructions on how to run the application]
